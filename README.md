### This repo consists of a CP question created for the recruitment task for Programmming Club in IITK.

Problem statement and editorial are provided. Use testcase.cpp to generate test cases.  

Note: I tried to generate solution to test pairs using the solution.cpp file(commented out code). But every time it gave segmentation fault.
You can try and download competitive programming helper by Divyanshu Agarwal and paste the generated test cases in the input fiels to get the coressponding output pairs.
